      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Marciah Machoka</strong>, a passionate and detail-oriented web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. I thrive on transforming creative ideas into elegant, functional, and user-friendly web applications.</p>

      <p>I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems and make a meaningful impact. Whether it's developing responsive interfaces, integrating APIs, or improving performance and accessibility, I always approach development with curiosity and care.</p>

      <p>Beyond coding, I'm a fast learner, a team player, and a consistent problem solver who values clean code and thoughtful design. I stay updated with the latest in tech to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

      <p>When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring design trends, experimenting with animations, or diving into UX best practices. I'm excited to keep growing as a developer and contribute to exciting and impactful projects.</p>
